# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Multiple Datasets with Classical Machine Learning Models
Welcome to my repository! Here, I've conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on multiple datasets and implemented classical machine learning models for analysis. This repository aims to provide insights into various datasets and demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

## Contents
* Datasets: Explore a variety of datasets covering different domains such as finance, healthcare, retail, etc.
* EDA Notebooks: Discover detailed exploratory data analysis notebooks for each dataset, highlighting key insights, visualizations, and data preprocessing steps.
* Machine Learning Models: Dive into the implementation of classical machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
* Evaluation Metrics: Understand the performance of models using relevant evaluation metrics and techniques.
* Documentation: Find detailed documentation on dataset descriptions, feature engineering techniques, model selection criteria, and more.
